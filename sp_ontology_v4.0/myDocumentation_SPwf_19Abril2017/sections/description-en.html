<h2 id="desc" class="list">SMART Protocols Ontology: workflow Module: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<p>The workflow module delivers an extensible representation describing the sequence of activities in an experimental protocol.
Our running example (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>), includes 3 laboratory procedures “Protocol overview” (indicating how to process the sample), “Prior to RNA extraction: cleaning process of equipment” and the “RNA extraction”. The first column in Table 2 includes the procedures from our running example. The second column includes subprocedures or instructions for each procedure.


The  “Protocol overview” (<a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab procedure 1</a>) has experimental input (<a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:has experimental input</a>) a tumor tissue (<a style="font-family:'Courier New'">nci:tumor tissue</a>) and has output (<a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:has output</a>) a homogenized tissue (<a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:homogenized tissue</a>). The laboratory procedure 1 includes 3 subprocedures (or steps/instructions) indicating how to manipulate and prepare the sample: <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab subprocedure1.1</a>, <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab subprocedure 1.2</a> and <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab subprocedure 1.3</a>. The order in which these subprocedures should be executed is represented by the BFO property <i>“is preceded by”</i> and <i>“precedes”</i>. The second lab procedure “Prior to RNA extraction: cleaning process of equipment" is a recipe describing how to clean the equipment to be used during the RNA extraction protocol. This recipe includes 3 steps, <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab subprocedure2.1</a>, <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab subprocedure 2.2</a> and <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:lab subprocedure 2.3</a>.


The last procedure “RNA extraction"  has as input the homogenized tissue (output from the lab procedure 1) and as output the <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">chebi:RNA</a>. It includes 20 subprocedures, these are not represented in the (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) due to lack of space. We propose the classes <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:laboratory procedure</a> and <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:laboratory subprocedure</a> for the representation of procedures and subprocedures. The property, <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:has procedure</a>, is used to represent procedures in the protocol; the property <a style="font-family:'Courier New'">sp:has subprocedure</a>, is used to characterize the subprocedures  that are part of a given procedure.

For representing “instruments”, “reagents/chemical compounds”, “organisms" and “sample/specimen” we are reusing, amongst others, NCBI organismal classification (<a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ncbitaxon.html">NCBI taxon</a>), Cell Line Ontology (<a href="http://www.clo-ontology.org">CLO</a>), BioAssay Ontology (<a href="http://bioassayontology.org">BAO</a>), The Experimental Factor Ontology (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/">EFO</a>), eagle-i resource ontology (<a href="https://open.med.harvard.edu/wiki/display/eaglei/Ontology">ERO</a>) and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/">ChEBI</a>).
